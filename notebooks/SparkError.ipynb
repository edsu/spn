    "There are several [full featured](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut) [options](https://github.com/helgeho/ArchiveSpark) for processing [WARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) data with Scala in Spark. Unfortunately if you aren't familiar with Scala these can seem like a little bit of a black box, where you aren't quite sure what's going on behind the scenes. This can be particularly problematic when understanding what is going on behind the scenes is critical for your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, if you happen to know Python there is [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html) which allows you to process your WARC data with the clearly documented [warcio](https://pypi.org/project/warcio/) library. The JVM isn't able to optimize Python code the same way it can Scala. But these performance difference really depend on what you are doing. And at any rate, you may be willing to trade off a bit of performance for an increase in readability. This notebook is a brief guide for processing WARC data using PySpark and warcio. Somewhat unhelpfully this notebook kind of assumes you are passingly familiar with Python, Spark and WARC already.\n",

In fact, researchers are often concerned with asking *novel* questions, that have never been asked before. So they are unlikely to be interested in your code that has already answered it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in the case of web archive data, it should be possible to have a simple framework for writing your own functions that analyze WARC records and use Spark to apply them right? An *extractor* function is a simple Python function that takes a `warcio.ArcWarcRecord` as an argument and returns data for processing in Spark. We will take a look at a simple *extractor* function in a moment. But before we do, how will we apply this function to all of our WARC data?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do do this we introduce the extractor *decorator*, which is a bit of syntactic sugar you use to annotate your extractor functions, to indicate that they are a function that will be iterating through a set of WARC records in a set of WARC files, and will apply your custom *extractor* function to each one. All the heavy lifting here is done by warcio, which is parsing the records."

Fortunately this hard part is over and we won't be writing any code like that again.\n",
