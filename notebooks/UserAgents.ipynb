    "# User Agents in SavePageNow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook examines the User Agents that were used when asking for content to be saved at Internet Archive's SavePageNow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The User-Agent string has been used since the early days of the web as a way of identifying the software that is being used to access a web page. It is currently defined by [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3) as a set of one ore more *product identifiers* which identify the software being used to perform the HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "    User-Agent      = product *( RWS ( product / comment ) )\n",
    "    product         = token [\"/\" product-version]\n",
    "    product-version = token\n",
    "    \n",
    "So for example the browser I am using now has this User-Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "The product identifiers here are typically listed in increasing levels of specificity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:66.0)\n",
    "* Gecko/20100101\n",
    "* Firefox/66.0\n",
    "\n",
    "But they are freeform enough that the [ua-parser](https://www.uaparser.org/) project has built up a voluminous set of regular expressions to parse and make sense of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, what can the User-Agent's in the SavePageNow data tell us about the people who are participating in creation of the Internet Archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the User-Agents that were used to archive the web content we need to excavate the SavePageNow WARC data. WARC files store verious [types of records](https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.1/#warc-type-mandatory). In this case we need to find the *Request* records that represent the HTTP request that was used by SavePageNow to archive the content from the Web. Using Spark with warcio is one way of doing this analysis:"

    "## Shifting Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "A few interesting things pop out from just looking at the top 10 User-Agents by year. The first is that SavePageNow itself as a piece of software infrastructure has changed over the years. In 2013 it archived content from the web as\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; archive.org_bot; Wayback Machine Live Record;\n",
    "    \n",
    "So as SavePageNow received requests from users to archive web content it simply went and requested those items from the web using a fixed User-Agent string. There is only one type of User-Agent that appears in all the HTTP requests in the WARC data for 2013 (or at least the day we sampled for that year).\n",
    "\n",
    "But in 2014 the User-Agent strings are much more varied. For example the top User-Agent was:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.104 Safari/537.36 (via Wayback Save Page)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This User-Agent string identifies a particular vesion of Chrome running on Windows. But also notice that appended on the end of this and other User-Agents in the list is the string `(via Wayback Save Page)`. It looks like in 2014 SavePageNow started using the User-Agent of the browser that original requestor, added an identifier for SavePageNow to the end, and then used that when requesting the web resource to archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in theory, web servers that log User-Agents would see User-Agents of that form in their server logs when SavePageNow was archiving content on their site.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then in 2016 things shift again and the top User-Agent changes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; archive.org_bot; Wayback Machine Live Record; +http://archive.org/details/archive.org_bot)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This User-Agent uniquely identifies *Wayback Machine Live Record* as a generic web client. While this is the #1 user agent for 2016, 2017, and 2018 it is always followed by a long tail of User-Agent strings that uniquely identifies a type of web client software, but the `(via Wayback Save Page)` has been dropped from the end. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.143 Safari/537.36 \t\n",
    "\n",
    "What might be going on here? \t\n",
    "\n",
    "One explanation is that in 2016 the SavePageNow software was adjusted so that when it archived web content it no longer appended `(via Wayback Save Page)` to the original User-Agent that requested the archive. It simply passed that original User-Agent through to its final destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the large number of `Wayback Machine Live Record` User-Agents is a bit of a mystery. When a browser requests something be archived could it be that request is passed through with the original User-Agent, but when it receives the HTML for that web page, and buids the DOM for it, resolving URLs for images, CSS, and JavaScript those subsequent requests get the `Wayback Machine Live Record` User-Agent when passing through SavePageNow? Or perhaps `Wayback Machine Live Record` is only used when no User-Agent is supplied initially? User-Agent is optional, and there appear to be no WARC records that lack it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's difficult to say without taking a much closer look at the WARC data. Which we will be doing in another notebook. It is interesting how in trying to use SavePageNow WARC data to understand the users of SavePageNow we've fallen down the rabbit hole of trying to understand the SavePageNow as a technical artifact.\n"

    "But 2017 is unusual in that by far the top-10 User-Agents account for the majority of the requests. Also there appears to have been almost double the amount of WARC request records that year, as compared to the year following. This is counter-intuitive because the amount of WARC data on disk does not follow that same trend. "

But what were these bots doing? Can we infer anything about what types of material was being archived by the two types of agents? Answering these questions is a topic for another notebook. But for now let's save a mapping of User-Agents to their family so we can use it later when processing WARC data."
